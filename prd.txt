Feature: Rate Limiter System

1. Create a Python class named 'RateLimiter' with __init__ method that accepts max_requests (int) and time_window (int) as parameters
2. The __init__ method MUST validate that max_requests is greater than 0
3. The __init__ method MUST validate that time_window is greater than 0
4. The class MUST implement method 'check_rate_limit' that accepts identifier (string) and returns tuple (bool, int)
5. The check_rate_limit method MUST return (True, 0) if request is allowed
6. The check_rate_limit method MUST return (False, retry_seconds) if limit is exceeded
7. The check_rate_limit method MUST track request timestamps for each identifier
8. The check_rate_limit method MUST remove expired requests older than time_window
9. The check_rate_limit method MUST handle None or empty identifier by raising ValueError
10. The class MUST implement method 'reset' that accepts identifier and clears its data
11. The code MUST use threading.Lock for thread safety
